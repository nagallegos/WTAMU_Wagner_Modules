        <h2>History of Malware and Viruses</h2>
        <p>The history of malware is long and varied. The term malware includes any software intentionally designed to cause damage to a computer, server, client, or computer network.</p>
        <p>The first known malware, the "Creeper" virus, was an experimental self-duplicating program written in 1971. It was not malicious, but it paved the way for the malware that would follow.</p>
        <p>In 1982, the "Elk Cloner" virus became the first known virus to spread in the wild. It infected Apple II computers via floppy disk.</p>
        <p>With the growth of the internet in the late 1980s and 1990s, malware like the "Morris worm" and "ILOVEYOU" virus spread widely and caused significant damage.</p>
        <p>Today, malware includes viruses, worms, trojans, ransomware, spyware, adware, and more. Each of these types of malware has its own history and ways of causing damage.</p>
